          START/STOP REDIS
          ________________

go to terminal on mac

start: redis-server
stop: Ctrl-C


!!! open new terminal 

command: redis-cli



in the  main terminal we see -> ...
                              Port: 6379
                              ...


in the second terminal tab we see -> (after running) redis-cli -> 127.0.0.1:6379      -> 6379 is identical, means we are connected

- we can test this with typing   ping

- we get a PONG back
